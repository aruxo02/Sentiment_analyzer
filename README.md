This is a simple but effective Python project that performs sentiment analysis on a set of text inputs using [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) from the `nltk` library.

It classifies each text as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**, and visualizes the results in a pie chart.
